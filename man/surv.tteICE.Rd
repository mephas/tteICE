\description{
This function estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
for time-to event data under ICH E9 (R1) to address intercurrent events. The input data 
should be of a competing risks structure.

\details{
\describe{
\item{Background}{Intercurrent events refer to the events occurring after treatment initiation of clinical trials that
affect either the interpretation of or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical
question of interest. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 (R1) addendum proposed
five strategies to address intercurrent events, namely, treatment policy strategy,
composite variable strategy, while on treatment strategy, hypothetical strategy, and principal stratum
strategy. To answer a specific scientific question, a strategy with a particular estimand is chosen
before the study design.}
\item{Model}{We adopt the potential outcomes framework that defines a causal estimand as the contrast between
functionals of potential outcomes. Consider a randomized controlled trial with \eqn{n} individuals
randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, denoted by \eqn{w}, where \eqn{w = 1} represents
the active treatment (a test drug) and \eqn{w = 0} represents the control (placebo). Assume that all
patients adhere to their treatment assignments and do not discontinue treatment. Associated with individual
\eqn{i = 1, ..., n} are two potential time-to-event primary outcomes \eqn{T_i(1)} and \eqn{T_i(0)},
if any, which represent the time durations from treatment initiation to the primary outcome event under
two treatment assignments respectively. Let \eqn{R_i(1)} and \eqn{R_i(0)} denote the occurrence time of
potential intercurrent events, if any, under the two treatment assignments, respectively. Intercurrent
events are considered as absent if no post-treatment intercurrent events occur until the end of study.}
\item{Estimand}{We adopt the potential cumulative incidences under both treatment assignments as the target estimands.
Potential cumulative incidences describe the probability of time-to-event outcomes occurring at each
time point. We define the treatment effect as the contrast of two potential cumulative incidences.
Cumulative incidences are model-free and collapsible, enjoying causal interpretations.}
