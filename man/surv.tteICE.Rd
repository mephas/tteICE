\arguments{
\item{A}{Treatment indicator, 1 for treatment and 0 for control.}

\item{Time}{Time to event.}

\item{cstatus}{Indicator of event, 1 for the primary event, 2 for the intercurrent event, 0 for censoring.}

\item{strategy}{Strategy to address intercurrent events, \code{"treatment"} indicating treatment policy strategy,
\code{"composite"} indicating composite variable strategy, \code{"natural"} indicating hypothetical strategy
(Scenario I, controlling the hazard of intercurrent events), \code{"removed"} indicating hypothetical strategy
(Scenario II, removing intercurrent events), \code{"whileon"} indicating while on treatment strategy, and
\code{"principal"} indicating principal stratum strategy.}

\item{cov1}{Baseline covariates.}

\item{method}{Estimation method, \code{"np"} indicating nonparametric estimation, \code{"np"} indicating inverse
treatment probability weighting, \code{"eff"} indicating semiparametrically efficient estimation based on efficient
influence functions.}

\item{weights}{Weight for each subject.}

\item{subset}{Subset, either numerical or logical.}

\item{na.rm}{Whether to remove missing values.}

\item{nboot}{Number of resamplings in the boostrapping method. If \code{nboot} is 0 or 1, then
asymptotic standard error based on the explicit form is calculated instead of bootstrapping.}

\description{
This function estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
for time-to event data under ICH E9 (R1) to address intercurrent events. The input data
should be of a competing risks structure.

\details{
\describe{
\item{Background}{Intercurrent events refer to the events occurring after treatment initiation of clinical trials that
affect either the interpretation of or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical
question of interest. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 (R1) addendum proposed
five strategies to address intercurrent events, namely, treatment policy strategy,
composite variable strategy, while on treatment strategy, hypothetical strategy, and principal stratum
strategy. To answer a specific scientific question, a strategy with a particular estimand is chosen
before the study design.}
\item{Model}{We adopt the potential outcomes framework that defines a causal estimand as the contrast between
functionals of potential outcomes. Consider a randomized controlled trial with \eqn{n} individuals
randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, denoted by \eqn{w}, where \eqn{w = 1} represents
the active treatment (a test drug) and \eqn{w = 0} represents the control (placebo). Assume that all
patients adhere to their treatment assignments and do not discontinue treatment. Associated with individual
\eqn{i = 1, ..., n} are two potential time-to-event primary outcomes \eqn{T_i(1)} and \eqn{T_i(0)},
if any, which represent the time durations from treatment initiation to the primary outcome event under
two treatment assignments respectively. Let \eqn{R_i(1)} and \eqn{R_i(0)} denote the occurrence time of
potential intercurrent events, if any, under the two treatment assignments, respectively. Intercurrent
events are considered as absent if no post-treatment intercurrent events occur until the end of study.}
\item{Estimand}{We adopt the potential cumulative incidences under both treatment assignments as the target estimands.
Potential cumulative incidences describe the probability of time-to-event outcomes occurring at each
time point. We define the treatment effect as the contrast of two potential cumulative incidences.
Cumulative incidences are model-free and collapsible, enjoying causal interpretations.}

## load data
data(bmt)
bmt = transform(bmt, d4=d2+d3)
A = as.numeric(bmt$group>1)

## Composite variable strategy, 
## nonparametric estimation without covariates

## Hypothetical strategy (natural effects), 
## nonparametric estimation with inverse probability weighting

## nonparametric estimation with weights as inverse propensity score

w = A/ps + (1-A)/(1-ps)
