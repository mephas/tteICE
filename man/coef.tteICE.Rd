\title{Coefficients of 'tteICE' objects}
\usage{
\method{coef}{tteICE}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted object returned by the function \code{tteICE}, \code{surv.tteICE}, or \code{scr.tteICE}.}

}
\value{
A list of coefficients of covariates in the working Cox models, stratified by treatment groups.
For the treatment policy strategy and composite variable strategy, only one Cox model is fit (for the primary
outcome event or the composite event). In these two strategies, \code{coef1} is the coefficients in the treated
group, \code{coef0} is the coefficients in the control group. For other strategies, Cox models are fitted for
each event (primary outcome event and intercurrent event). In these strategies, \code{coef11} is the coefficients
for the primary outcome event in the treatment group, \code{coef10} is the coefficients for the primary outcome
event in the control group, \code{coef21} is the coefficients for the intercurrent event in the treated group,
\code{coef20} is the coefficients for the intercurrent in the control group.

This function extracts the coefficients in the Cox models
