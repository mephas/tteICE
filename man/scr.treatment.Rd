\description{
This function nonparametrically estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
using treatment policy strategy (semicompeting risks data structure). This strategy ignores the intercurrent
event and uses the time to the primary event as it was recorded.

\details{
\describe{
The treatment policy strategy addresses the problem of intercurrent events by expanding
the initial treatment conditions to a treatment policy. This strategy is applicable
only if intercurrent events do not hinder primary outcome events. The treatments under
comparison are now two treatment policies: \eqn{(w, R(w))}, where \eqn{w = 1, 0}. One policy
\eqn{(1,R(1))} involves administering the test drug, along with any naturally occurring
intercurrents, whereas the other policy \eqn{(0,R(0))} involves administering a placebo,
along with any naturally occurring intercurrents. Thus, the potential outcomes are
\eqn{T(1,R(1))} and \eqn{T(0,R(0))}. Instead of comparing the test drug and placebo themselves,
the contrast of interest is made between the two treatment policies. The difference in
cumulative incidences under the two treatment policies is then
\eqn{\tau(t) = P(T(1, R(1)) < t) - P(T(0, R(0)) < t),}{ATE_tp}
representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing primary outcome events during
\eqn{(0,t)} under active treatment and placebo. \cr
The average treatment effect \eqn{\tau^{\text{tp}}(t)} has a meaningful causal interpretation
only when \eqn{T(1, R(1))} and \eqn{T(0, R(0))} are well defined. Because the treatment policy
includes the occurrence of the intercurrent event as natural, the entire treatment policy is
determined by manipulating the initial treatment condition $w$ only. Therefore, we can simplify
the notations \eqn{T(w, R(w)) = T(w)} in defining estimands. As such,
\eqn{\tau(t) = P(T(1)) < t) - P(T(0) < t)} as the intention-to-treat analysis.
