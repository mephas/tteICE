\description{
This function estimates the potential cumulative incidence function based on
efficient influence functions using hypothetical strategy (semicompeting risks data structure).
Cox models are employed for survival models. The intercurrent event is assumed to be absent
in the hypothetical scenario.
}
\details{
\describe{
The hypothetical strategy envisions a hypothetical clinical trial condition where the occurrence
of intercurrent events is restricted in certain ways. By doing so, the distribution of potential
outcomes under the hypothetical scenario can capture the impact of intercurrent events explicitly
through a pre-specified criterion. We use \eqn{T'(w)}, \eqn{w = 1, 0} to denote the time to the
primary outcome event in the hypothetical scenario. The time-dependent treatment effect specific
to this hypothetical scenario is written as
\eqn{\tau(t) = P(T'(1) < t) - P(T'(0) < t),}
representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing primary outcome events during \eqn{(0,t)}
in the pre-specified hypothetical scenario under active treatment and placebo. \cr
The key question is how to envision \eqn{T'(w)}. We manipulate the hazard specific to intercurrent
event \eqn{\lambda_2(t; w)} while assuming the cause-specific hazard specific to the primary outcome event
under no intercurrent events \eqn{\lambda_1(t; w)} remains unchanged. Specifically, we envision that
intercurrent events are absent in the hypothetical scenario for all individuals, so
\eqn{\lambda_2'(t;0) = \Lambda_2'(t;1) = 0}. This hypothetical scenario leads to an estimand called the
marginal cumulative incidence. The treatment effect corresponds to the controlled direct effect with the
intercurrent events removed.
