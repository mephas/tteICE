The goal of the package “tteICE” is to estimate the treatment effect for
time-to-event outcomes with intercurrent events.

## Randomized trials and observational studies

**Randomized trials** are the best form of experiments for evaluating
the treatment effect because confounders are naturally balanced between
treatment groups. The difference in outcomes between treatment groups is
explained by the treatment condition. In observational studies,
confounders (observed or unobserved) are not balanced. To estimate the
treatment effect, we need to assume all confounders are collected. Then
we may use matching, weighting, or emulating trial methods to create a
sample analogue to randomized trials. Although methods for randomized
trials apply to observational studies after adjusting for confounders,
one should be careful in making causal conclusions based on
observational studies due to the threat of unmeasured confounding.

## Five strategies to deal with intercurrent events

**The ICH E9 (R1)** proposed five strategies to deal with intercurrent
events: treatment policy strategy, composite variable strategy,
hypothetical strategy, while on treatment strategy, and principal
stratum strategy. To answer a specific scientific question, a
corresponding strategy should be chosen before the experimental design
and data analysis. The estimand to describe the distribution of the time
to the primary outcome event is the potential cumulative incidence
function (CIF). The treatment effect is defined as the contrast of the
potential cumulative incidence functions under treated and control.

- **Treatment policy strategy.** The treatment policy strategy addresses
  the problem of intercurrent events by expanding the initial treatment
  conditions to a treatment policy. This strategy is applicable only if
  intercurrent events do not hinder primary outcome events. It is
  confined to a semicompeting risks context.
- **Composite variable strategy.** The composite variable strategy
  addresses the problem of intercurrent events by expanding the outcome
  variables. It aggregates the intercurrent event and primary outcome
  event into a single composite outcome variable.
- **Hypothetical strategy.** The hypothetical strategy envisions a
  hypothetical clinical trial condition where the occurrence of
  intercurrent events is restricted in certain ways. By doing so, the
  distribution of potential outcomes under the hypothetical scenario can
  capture the impact of intercurrent events explicitly through a
  pre-specified criterion. The hypothetical strategy is closely related
  to mediation analysis, which is intended to evaluate the direct and
  indirect effects using semicompeting risks data.
- **While on treatment strategy.** The while on treatment strategy
  considers the measure of outcome variables taken only up to the
  occurrence of intercurrent events. The failures of primary outcome
  events should not be counted in the cumulative incidences if
  intercurrent events occurred. The while on treatment strategy is
  closely related to the competing risks model.
- **Principal stratum strategy.** The principal stratum strategy aims to
  stratify the population into subpopulations based on the joint
  potential occurrences of intercurrent events under the two treatment
  assignments. Usually, we are interested in a principal stratum
  comprised of individuals who would never experience intercurrent
  events, regardless of which treatment they receive. A principal
  ignorability assumption is made.

## Two types of data structures

In particular, we consider two types of data structures.

- **Competing risks.** Only the time to the first occurrence of either
  the primary outcome event or the intercurrent event is recorded. An
  indicator describes the type of this event, i.e., whether it is the
  primary outcome event, intercurrent event, or censoring. The treatment
  policy strategy cannot be applied to competing risks data.
- **Semicompeting risks.** Both the time to the primary outcome event
  and the time to the intercurrent event are recorded. The censoring
  indicators for these events are also recorded. All five strategies can
  be applied to semicompeting risks data.

The composite variable strategy, while on treatment strategy, principal
stratum strategy, and hypothetical strategy (II, removed) yield the same
results for the competing risks and semicompeting risks data, since only
the first occurrence of events is used. The hypothetical strategy (I,
natural) yields different results for the competing risks and
semicompeting risks data, since both cause-specific hazards of the
primary event contribute to the counterfactual cumulative incidence
function for semicompeting risk data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of “tteICE” from GitHub with:

**(We are updaing the package)**

Alternatively, you can install “tteICE” from R CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("tteICE")
```

## Example

We use the `bmt` data to illustrate how to estimate the treatment
effect. The primary event is death, and the intercurrent event is
relapse.

## Competing risks data structure

The time to the first event (either death or relapse) is t2. The event
indicator is d4=d2+d3, so that d4=1 if death occurs first, while d4=2 if
relapse occurs first.

``` r
library(tteICE)
data(bmt)
A = as.numeric(bmt$group>1)
X = as.matrix(bmt[,c('z1','z3','z5')])
bmt = transform(bmt, d4=d2+d3)
```

Suppose we would like to use the hypothetical strategy (natural
effects). We fit the model by nonparametric estimation.

``` r
fit1 = surv.tteICE(A, bmt$t2, bmt$d4, "natural")
plot_inc(fit1, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_1-1.png)

``` r

plot_ate(fit1)
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_1-2.png)

``` r
## We can also use bootstrap confidence intervals
# plot_ate(fit1, nboot=200)
```

We can also use inverse probability weighting to account for
confounding.

``` r
fit2 = surv.tteICE(A, bmt$t2, bmt$d4, "natural", X, method='ipw')
plot_inc(fit2, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_2-1.png)

``` r

plot_ate(fit2)
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_2-2.png)

To increase efficiency, we use the efficient influence function
(EIF)-based method.

``` r
fit3 = surv.tteICE(A, bmt$t2, bmt$d4, "natural", X, method='eff')
plot_inc(fit3, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_3-1.png)

``` r

plot_ate(fit3)
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_3-2.png)

## Semicompeting risks data structure

Note that the time to death (or censoring) is t1 and the time to relapse
(or censoring) is t2. We use the hypothetical strategy (natural effects)
and fit the model nonparametrically.

``` r
fit4 = scr.tteICE(A, bmt$t1, bmt$d1, bmt$t2, bmt$d2, "natural")
plot_inc(fit4, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_4-1.png)

``` r

plot_ate(fit4)
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_4-2.png)

``` r
## We can also use bootstrap confidence intervals
# plot_ate(fit4, nboot=200)
```

We can also use inverse probability weighting to account for
confounding.

``` r
fit5 = scr.tteICE(A, bmt$t1, bmt$d1, bmt$t2, bmt$d2, "natural", X, method='ipw')
plot_inc(fit5, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_5-1.png)

``` r

plot_ate(fit5)
```

![](reference/figures/README-example_5-2.png)

To increase efficiency, we use the efficient influence function
(EIF)-based method.

``` r
# fit6 = scr.tteICE(A, bmt$t1, bmt$d1, bmt$t2, bmt$d2, "natural", X, method='eff') ??
# plot_inc(fit6, plot.configs=list(legend=c('AML','ALL')))

# plot_ate(fit6)
```

## Remarks on methodology

To identify the potential CIF and treatment effect, we make the
following assumptions. When the semiparametrically efficient estimation
method is used, these assumptions are made conditional on covariates.

- Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). All individuals are
  independent, and there is only one version of potential outcomes
  associated with each treatment condition.
- Consistency. The potential time to events and event indicators
  associated with the realized treatment condition are observable.
- Randomization. The treatment is independent of potential outcomes,
  i.e., the treatment assignment is randomized.
- Random censoring. The potential censoring time is independent of
  potential event times.
- Positivity. There is a positive probability for each individual to be
  treated or controlled. There is a positive probability that the
  censoring time is larger than the end of study.
- Principal ignorability. The potential time to the primary outcome
  event does not rely on the cross-world potential time to the
  intercurrent event. This assumption is only required for the principal
  stratum strategy.

The five strategies differ in the scientific questions to answer and,
therefore, incorporate intercurrent events differently. The treatment
policy strategy considers the effect on primary outcome events with
intercurrent events as natural. Because the intercurrent event is
considered part of the treatment condition, any difference in the
hazards of intercurrent events between the treatment groups reflects the
effect of the treatment policy. The composite variable strategy
considers a composite of the primary outcome event and the intercurrent
event. The while on treatment strategy estimand quantifies the total
effect on the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome event, which
is contributed by two sources: one is the effect of changing the hazard
of primary outcome events, and the other is the effect of changing the
hazard of intercurrent events. The first source is also quantified by
the hypothetical strategy estimand Scenario I. The principal stratum
strategy considers a subpopulation defined by potential intercurrent
events, typically where such events would not occur under either
treatment condition.

In general, the hypothetical strategy and principal stratum strategy
target some direct effects, while other strategies target some total
effects. Identifying direct effects requires stronger assumptions, such
as sequential ignorability or principal ignorability. Under the
multi-state model, let the original status, intercurrent event status,
and primary outcome event status be three compartments. Then the
potential CIF under the composite variable strategy is the probability
of being in either state of intercurrent events or primary outcome
events, whereas the potential CIF under the while on treatment strategy
is the probability of being in the state of primary outcome events
developed directly following the initial status. If the data are of the
semi-competing risks structure, the potential CIF under the treatment
policy strategy represents the probability of being in the state of
primary outcome events, regardless of whether intercurrent events occur
before the primary outcome events.
