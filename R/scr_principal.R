#' @title Fit the CIF using principal stratum strategy for semicompeting risks data
#'
#' @description This function nonparametrically estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
#' using principal stratum strategy (semicompeting risks data structure). The estimand is defined in a
#' subpopulation where intercurrent events would never occur regardless of treatment conditions.
#'
#' @param A Treatment indicator, 1 for treatment and 0 for control.
#'
#' @param Time Time to the primary (terminal) event.
#'
#' @param status Indicator of the primary (terminal) event, 1 for event and 0 for censoring.
#'
#' @param Time_int Time to the intercurrent event.
#'
#' @param status_int Indicator of the intercurrent event, 1 for event and 0 for censoring.
#'
#' @param weights Weight for each subject.
#'
#' @param subset Subset, either numerical or logical.

#' \describe{
#' The principal stratum strategy aims to stratify the population into subpopulations based on the joint
#' potential occurrences of intercurrent events under the two treatment assignments \eqn{(R(1), R(0))}.
#' Suppose we are interested in a principal stratum comprised of individuals who would never experience
#' intercurrent events, regardless of which treatment they receive. This principal stratum can be indicated
#' by \eqn{\{R(1)=R(0)=\infty\}}. The treatment effect is now defined within this subpopulation,
#' \eqn{\tau(t) = P(T(1) < t \mid R(1)=R(0)=\infty) - P(T(0) < t \mid R(1)=R(0)=\infty),}
#' representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing primary outcome events during \eqn{(0,t)}
#' under active treatment and placebo in the subpopulation that will not experience intercurrent events
#' regardless of treatment during \eqn{(0,t)}. A principal ignorability assumption is made for identification.
#' If the size of the target principal stratum is small, the results could be highly variable.
