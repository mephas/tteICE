#' @title Fit the CIF using hypothetical strategy (I) for competing risks data
#'
#' @description This function nonparametrically estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
#' using hypothetical strategy (competing risks data structure). The intercurrent event is only
#' permitted under treated if it would occur under control.
#'
#' @param A Treatment indicator, 1 for treatment and 0 for control.
#'
#' @param Time Time to event.
#'
#' @param cstatus Indicator of event, 1 for the primary event, 2 for the intercurrent event, 0 for censoring.
#'
#' @param weights Weight for each subject.
#'
#' @param subset Subset, either numerical or logical.

#' \describe{
#' The hypothetical strategy envisions a hypothetical clinical trial condition where the occurrence
#' of intercurrent events is restricted in certain ways. By doing so, the distribution of potential
#' outcomes under the hypothetical scenario can capture the impact of intercurrent events explicitly
#' through a pre-specified criterion. We use \eqn{T'(w)}, \eqn{w = 1, 0} to denote the time to the
#' primary outcome event in the hypothetical scenario. The time-dependent treatment effect specific
#' to this hypothetical scenario is written as
#' \eqn{\tau(t) = P(T'(1) < t) - P(T'(0) < t),}
#' representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing primary outcome events during \eqn{(0,t)}
#' in the pre-specified hypothetical scenario under active treatment and placebo. \cr
#' The key question is how to envision \eqn{T'(w)}. We manipulate the hazard specific to intercurrent
#' event \eqn{\lambda_2(t; w)} while assuming the hazard specific to the primary outcome event
#' \eqn{\lambda_1(t; w)} remains unchanged. Specifically, we envision that the intercurrent events that
#' occurred when individuals were assigned to test drugs were only permitted if these intercurrent events
#' would have also occurred if these individuals had been assigned to the placebo. In this hypothetical
#' scenario, when assigned to placebo, individuals would be equally likely to experience intercurrent
#' events as they are assigned to placebo in the real-world trial in terms of the hazards; when assigned
#' to test drug, the hazard of intercurrent events would be identical to that if assigned to placebo in
#' the real-world trial. That is, \eqn{\lambda_2'(t;0) = \lambda_2'(t;1) = \lambda_2(t;0)}. The treatment
#' effect corresponds to the natural direct effect with the hazard of intercurrent events set at
#' the level under control.
