#' using hypothetical strategy (semicompeting risks data structure). The intercurrent event is assumed to
#' be absent in the hypothetical scenario.

#' \describe{
#' The hypothetical strategy envisions a hypothetical clinical trial condition where the occurrence
#' of intercurrent events is restricted in certain ways. By doing so, the distribution of potential
#' outcomes under the hypothetical scenario can capture the impact of intercurrent events explicitly
#' through a pre-specified criterion. We use \eqn{T'(w)}, \eqn{w = 1, 0} to denote the time to the
#' primary outcome event in the hypothetical scenario. The time-dependent treatment effect specific
#' to this hypothetical scenario is written as
#' \eqn{\tau(t) = P(T'(1) < t) - P(T'(0) < t),}
#' representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing primary outcome events during \eqn{(0,t)}
#' in the pre-specified hypothetical scenario under active treatment and placebo. \cr
#' The key question is how to envision \eqn{T'(w)}. We manipulate the hazard specific to intercurrent
#' event \eqn{\lambda_2(t; w)} while assuming the hazard specific to the primary outcome event
#' \eqn{\lambda_1(t; w)} remains unchanged. Specifically, we envision that intercurrent events are
#' absent in the hypothetical scenario for all individuals, so \eqn{\lambda_2'(t;0) = \Lambda_2'(t;1) = 0}.
#' This hypothetical scenario leads to an estimand called the marginal cumulative incidence. The treatment
#' effect corresponds to the controlled direct effect with the intercurrent events removed.
