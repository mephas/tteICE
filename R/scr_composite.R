#' @title Fit the CIF using composite variable strategy for semicompeting risks data
#'
#' @description This function nonparametrically estimates the potential cumulative incidence function
#' using composite variable strategy (semicompeting risks data structure). This strategy adopts the
#' first occurrence of either the intermediate or primary event as the event of interest.
#'
#' @param A Treatment indicator, 1 for treatment and 0 for control.
#'
#' @param Time Time to the primary (terminal) event.
#'
#' @param status Indicator of the primary (terminal) event, 1 for event and 0 for censoring.
#'
#' @param Time_int Time to the intercurrent event.
#'
#' @param status_int Indicator of the intercurrent event, 1 for event and 0 for censoring.
#'
#' @param weights Weight for each subject.
#'
#' @param subset Subset, either numerical or logical.

#' \describe{
#' The composite variable strategy addresses the problem of intercurrent events by expanding the
#' outcome variables. It aggregates the intercurrent event and the primary outcome event into a single
#' composite outcome variable. The idea is not new in the context of progression-free survival,
#' where the composite outcome variable is defined as the occurrence of either a non-terminal event
#' (e.g., cancer progression) or a terminal event (e.g., death). One widely used composite outcome
#' variable has the form \eqn{Q(w) = \min\{T(w), R(w)\}} for \eqn{w = 1, 0}. When this simple form
#' is adopted, the difference in counterfactual cumulative incidences is
#' \eqn{\tau(t) = P( Q(1) < t ) - P( Q(0) < t ),}
#' representing the difference in probabilities of experiencing either intercurrent events or primary
#' outcome events during \eqn{(0,t)} under active treatment and placebo.
