Description: This package implements methods for estimating and inferring the cumulative incidence functions for time-to-event outcomes with intercurrent events under the 
five strategies outlined in the ICH E9 (R1) addendum. This package can be used for analyzing data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies. In 
general, we have a primary outcome event and possibly an intercurrent event. Two data structures are allowed: competing risks, where only the time to the first event is 
recorded, and semicompeting risks, where the times to both the primary outcome event and intercurrent event (or censoring) are recorded. For estimation methods, users can 
choose nonparametric estimation (which does not use covariates) and semiparametrically efficient estimation.
